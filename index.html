				<p>This web page has been built for the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree project number 2: "Build a Portfolio Site." The grid based layout was implemented using the Bootstrap framework, which is also handling the responsive layout when scaling the page down by resizing the browser window from a desktop, or viewing the page on a mobile device.  In the event that this page is viewed 
				from a high resolution device, a source set has been defined in the html which will cause a 2x resolution image to be displayed to a higher resolution device, while a 1x resolution image is displayed by default.</p>
				<p>The logo in the upper left-hand corner, as opposed to being served as an image, is being displayed by using a cursive font from the Google Fonts api, and is encapsulated with a border styled
				with varying corner radiuses in CSS which creates the leaf-shape surrounding the initials.</p>
				<p>These are some projects that I have completed in the past.  Clicking on any of the projects below will launch a modal that will
				give you more information about the project and a link to the website (where applicable) or the Github repository.</p>

						<p>The "Fresh Tomatoes" movie website was created as my first project submission for the
							Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree, and was an integral part of the "Python Fundamentals" course.
							The exercise was intended to demonstrate the concept of Object Oriented Programming by creating
							a 'movie' class with various properties such as title, release date, storyline, director, etc, and then 
							re-using that class to create several movie instances.

						<h4 class="modal-title">New Crimson Accord - Development Site</h4>
					</div>
					<div class="modal-body">
						<p>This site is currently in testing stage.  I built this site for a friend who runs a live action role playing 
							(LARP) game.  These games involve a lot of paperwork, as each player will have a sheet for their stats, and 
							multiple sheets of narratives between the player, the game's story-telling staff, and other characters in the
							game.  My friend needed an easier way to manage accounting for and emailing all of these documents to each player.
						</p>
						<p>I created this site based on a Bootstrap Framework, built a MySQL database to hold the documents in blob format and
							all the other related information required by his game model, and implemented PHP code to access the data.  The site
							enables my friend and his staff to review and track documents received from players, then upload new documents for each 
							player, as well as groups of related players, then email the documents out to all the players at once and post them
							to be viewable by players on the website once logged in.
						</p>
						<p>This site is just now rolling out of testing, but the dev version is available at <a href="http://test.crimsonaccord.com" target="_blank">test.crimsonaccord.com</a>

					<div class="modal-body">
						<p>Crimson Accord is a website that I created for my friend's LARP game.  I installed and configured Joomla and some extra modules
							such as a lightbox gallery and extended user access permissions.  I also created the custom css templates.
						</p>
						<p>After using the site for a while, we learned that Joomla was fine for mass publishing a lot of content to a general audience, but in
							his situation, he needed a few pages of content (each page user specific), available to each of the 60 or so players in the game, and 
							also a way for the players to respond in a more controlled environment than general comments on a blog post.  Joomla just wasn't the 
							right fit for doing that kind of thing, so I decided to make a purpose-built alternative, thus the Test Crimson Accord site was born.

						<p>The Joomla! Crimson Accord site is viewable at <a href="http://crimsonaccord.com" target="_blank">crimsonaccord.com</a>

						<p>My friend Lisa Alexander was building a brand for herself as a guru of 'green living'.  She had hired a web developer to create a website
						to showcase her video clips on TV talk shows and document her renovation of an old farm house into an energy efficient modern home.
						</p>
						<p>The person she hired set up a bare-bones Joomla! site and disappeared as soon as he got a paycheck (from what I was told), and I was asked
							to step in and take over the project.  I reinstalled a current Joomla! version, set up the configuration, and designed and built the 
							CSS templates.
						</p>
						<p>These days, Lisa has moved on from being an environmental guru to doing something with aligning people's chakras using tuning forks, 
							but her Green site is still there at <a href="http://livebetterlivegreen.com" target="_blank">Live Better, Live Green</a>

						<p>My husband has this fondness for hosting pig roasts in our back yard, which invoves weeks of prep digging a pit, lining it with cinder blocks
							meticulously wrapped in aluminum foil and stacked just-so, but still, the pork was never cooked before the guests were all drunk and full from 
							eating snacks.  Thus came the idea of automating the pig roast....
						</p>
						<p>My husband, being an engineer and very thrifty, re-purposed the motor of my treadmill to act as a rotisserie for the pig, and I, being a computer
							nerd, repurposed some Arduino code designed for sending a Tweet from an Arduino equipped with a wifi shield and a Twitter token.  Then I bought a 
							couple of cheap thermisters from Amazon, calibrated (loosly speaking) their resistance to a somewhat accurate temperature reading with resistors on 
							a breadboard and coffee cups of hot and cold water, then coded it to the Arduino and soldered everything together.  The day of the pig roast, we just 
							stuck the thermister probes in the appropriate places for loins or hams, and never needed to take the thing apart or stop the rotisserie...the temps 
							were being sent as a twitter feed that we could just check on our phones.
						</p>
						<p>The Arduino code is <a href="https://github.com/melissapott/arduino_thermistor_tweet" target="_blank">here </a>(and I did borrow some)
